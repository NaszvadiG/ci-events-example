CodeIgniter Events Library
###################

I plan on releasing a stripped down version of my CodeIgniter Framework extensions soon...
but, I figured this could be used as is now.

It includes the following the library it pretty self explanatory and some what commented

public register($name,$closure,$priority=0);
public trigger($name,&$a=null,&$b=null,&$c=null,&$d=null,&$e=null,&$f=null,&$g=null,&$h=null);
public has_event($name);
public events();
public clear();
